# Context
This is a baseline implementation of the [SQuAD](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) question and answering system. The goals with this repo is to learn about some of the challenges associated with building NLP systems and also to provide a starting point from which to create a more general Q & A dataset based on unlabeled data.

## Set Up

	1. Run the set up shell script to ensure that you have all of the local dependencies needed. `sh set_up.sh`.
	
	1. It is also important to make sure you have the data downloaded. I recommend setting the `import_data` flag to `True` if you need to download the data.
